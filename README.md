#### Installation Order

```
REQUIRED (Native Install):
─────────────────────────
1. Node.js (for SanctumWriter)
2. Ollama OR LM Studio (for AI) ← Install directly, NOT in Docker

OPTIONAL (Docker-based):
────────────────────────
3. Docker Desktop (only if using search features below)
4. SearXNG (privacy search - runs in Docker)
5. Perplexica (AI search - runs in Docker)

FINALLY:
────────
6. SanctumWriter
```

> ⚠️ **Note**: Install Ollama/LM Studio natively on your machine (not in Docker). While Docker versions exist, native installation gives better performance and GPU access.

---

### Setting Up Ollama (Recommended)

```bash
# 1. Install Ollama from https://ollama.ai

# 2. Pull a writing-focused model
ollama pull qwen3:latest

# 3. Start the server (runs on port 11434)
ollama serve
```

### Setting Up LM Studio (Alternative)

1. Download from [lmstudio.ai](https://lmstudio.ai)
2. Load a model (e.g., Llama 3, Mistral, Qwen)
3. Go to **Local Server** tab → **Start Server** (runs on port 1234)

### Setting Up Search Services (Optional)

**SearXNG** (Privacy-focused search):
```bash
# Using Docker
docker run -d --name searxng -p 4000:8080 searxng/searxng
```

**Perplexica** (AI-powered search):
```bash
# Clone and follow setup instructions
git clone https://github.com/ItzCrazyKns/Perplexica.git
cd Perplexica
# See their README for Docker setup (runs on port 3000)
```

---

### Installing SanctumWriter

#### Option A: Standard Installation (npm)

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/lafintiger/SanctumWriter.git
cd SanctumWriter

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start the app
npm run dev
```

Open **http://localhost:3125** in your browser.

#### Option B: Docker Installation 🐳

**Quick Start (uses Ollama on your host machine):**
```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/lafintiger/SanctumWriter.git
cd SanctumWriter

# Build and run
docker-compose up -d

# View logs
docker-compose logs -f
```

**With Ollama in Docker (no local Ollama needed):**
```bash
# Start app + Ollama container
docker-compose --profile ollama up -d

# Pull a model into the container
docker exec sanctum-ollama ollama pull qwen3:latest
```

**Development with hot-reloading:**
```bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up
```

| Docker Command | Description |
|----------------|-------------|
| `docker-compose up -d` | Start app (connects to host Ollama) |
| `docker-compose --profile ollama up -d` | Start app + Ollama container |
| `docker-compose down` | Stop all services |
| `docker-compose logs -f` | View live logs |
| `docker-compose build --no-cache` | Rebuild after code changes |

**Environment Variables:**
```bash
# Create .env file for custom settings
OLLAMA_URL=http://host.docker.internal:11434
LMSTUDIO_URL=http://host.docker.internal:1234
DEFAULT_PROVIDER=ollama
DEFAULT_MODEL=llama3
```

> 💡 **Tip**: Your documents are persisted in the `./documents` folder. RAG/session-memory data (embeddings, saved research, preferences) is stored as JSON in your **browser's localStorage**, not in a Docker volume — it lives with whichever browser/profile you use to open the app, so it won't follow you to a different browser or machine.

2. Chat shows "Selection active"
3. Ask: *"Rewrite this"* or *"Make it more concise"*
4. AI directly modifies just the selected text

## ⚙️ Configuration

### Service URLs (Settings Panel)

Configure your local services in the Settings modal. All URLs are customizable if you use non-default ports:

| Service | Default URL | Purpose | Project |
|---------|-------------|---------|---------|
| Ollama | `http://localhost:11434` | Local LLM inference | [ollama.ai](https://ollama.ai) |
| LM Studio | `http://localhost:1234` | Alternative local LLM | [lmstudio.ai](https://lmstudio.ai) |
| SearXNG | `http://localhost:4000` | Privacy-focused search | [GitHub](https://github.com/searxng/searxng) |
| Perplexica | `http://localhost:3000` | AI-powered search | [GitHub](https://github.com/ItzCrazyKns/Perplexica) |
| ComfyUI | `http://localhost:8188` | Image generation | [GitHub](https://github.com/comfyanonymous/ComfyUI) |

> 💡 **Tip**: If running services in Docker, use `localhost:PORT` — SanctumWriter runs on your host machine and can reach Docker containers via localhost.

### Workspace Folder

Set your working directory in Settings → Workspace. Works great with **Obsidian vaults**!

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Framework**: Next.js 14 (App Router)
- **Editor**: CodeMirror 6
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **State**: Zustand
- **Vector DB**: None — RAG uses a JSON document store in browser `localStorage` with brute-force in-memory cosine similarity (see `lib/rag/vectorStore.ts`); not a real vector database and not suited to large document sets. (`@lancedb/lancedb` is listed as a dependency but is unused — see [Known Limitations](#-known-limitations).)
- **LLM**: Ollama / LM Studio

---

## ⚠️ Known Limitations

- **RAG storage is browser localStorage, not a vector database.** The Knowledge Base, Session Memory, and Research collections are all stored as JSON in your browser's localStorage and searched with brute-force in-memory cosine similarity (`lib/rag/vectorStore.ts`). This is fine for a handful of documents but will not scale to a large knowledge base, is per-browser/per-profile (won't sync across browsers or machines), and is subject to your browser's localStorage quota (a few MB, typically). `@lancedb/lancedb` appears in `package.json` but isn't used anywhere in the app.

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "Ollama not available"
```bash
# Make sure Ollama is running
ollama serve

# Check it's accessible
curl http://localhost:11434/api/tags
```

### Models not showing
```bash
# Pull a model first
ollama pull qwen3:latest

# Or for a smaller model
ollama pull gemma3:4b
```

### Port conflict
The app runs on port **3125** by default. If you need a different port, modify `package.json`.
